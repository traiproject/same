## Vision

The vision for Remote Caching in `same` is to enable a "write once, read many" workflow for build artifacts. By uploading build outputs to a shared storage backend (like S3 or GCS), we can ensure that if one person (or CI runner) builds a target, no one else needs to rebuild it.

### How it Works

Currently, `same` uses a Local CAS (Content Addressable Store) to cache build results on your machine. With Remote Caching:

1.  **Push**: When a build completes successfully, the artifacts are hashed and uploaded to a remote object store.
2.  **Pull**: Before starting a build, `same` checks the remote cache. If the artifacts for the current inputs (source code, dependencies, environment) already exist, they are downloaded immediately.

### Benefits

*   **Faster CI Pipelines**: CI agents can share caches, drastically reducing build times for incremental changes.
*   **Collaborative Development**: Developers can pull artifacts built by CI or other team members, skipping expensive local builds.
*   **Cost Savings**: Reduced compute time translates to lower infrastructure costs.
