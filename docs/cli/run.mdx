description: "Run specified tasks"

The `run` command is the primary command used to execute tasks and targets defined in your workspace.

```bash
same run [targets...]
```

## Arguments

The command accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, which are interpreted as targets to run.

- **`targets`**: A list of project names, task aliases, or specific task targets (e.g., `project:task`) to execute.

If no targets are provided, the command displays the help message.

## Flags

### `--no-cache`

**Short flag:** `-n`

Bypass the build cache and force task execution. This is useful when you want to ensure that all tasks are re-executed regardless of their cached state.

```bash
same run build --no-cache
```

### `--inspect`

**Short flag:** `-i`

Inspect the TUI (Terminal User Interface) after the build completes (prevents auto-exit). By default, the `same` CLI exits immediately after the build finishes (whether successful or failed). Using the `--inspect` flag prevents auto-exit, allowing you to:

- Scroll through the logs of completed tasks.
- Inspect the state of the dependency graph.
- Review any errors in detail within the TUI.

```bash
same run test --inspect
```

## Examples

Run a single target named `build`:
```bash
same run build
```

Run multiple targets (`build` and `test`) in parallel (where dependencies allow):
```bash
same run build test
```

## Behavior

- **Parallel Execution**: `same` will automatically determine the dependency graph and execute tasks in parallel where possible.
- **Caching**: By default, `same` will skip tasks that have already been computed and whose inputs haven't changed. Use the [`--no-cache`](#no-cache) flag to bypass this.
- **TUI**: The command launches an interactive Terminal User Interface to display progress.
