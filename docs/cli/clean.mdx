description: "Clean the build cache and artifacts"
---

The `clean` command removes cached data and artifacts from your workspace to help resolve issues or free up disk space.

```bash
same clean [flags]
```

## Behavior

By default, when run without any flags, the `clean` command removes the Build Info Store, which contains the cache of task outputs and execution metadata. This is useful when you want to force a clean rebuild of all tasks.

## Flags

### `--tools`

**Short flag:** `-t`

Removes the tool resolution caches, including NixHub and Environment caches. This is useful if tool provisioning is broken or you're experiencing issues with tools not being resolved correctly.

```bash
same clean --tools
```

### `--all`

**Short flag:** `-a`

Removes all caches, including Build, Tools, and Environments. This performs a complete cleanup of all cached data.

```bash
same clean --all
```

## Examples

Clean only the build cache (default behavior):
```bash
same clean
```

Clean only the tool resolution caches:
```bash
same clean --tools
```

Clean all caches:
```bash
same clean --all
```

Clean all caches using the short flag:
```bash
same clean -a
```
