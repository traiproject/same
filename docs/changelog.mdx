<Update label="v0.0.1" description="v0 Beta Release">
  ## Initial Release

  We are excited to announce the first major version of `same`! This release focuses on establishing the core foundations for hermetic and reproducible builds.

  ### Key Features

  *   **Hermetic Builds**: Guaranteed reproducibility by isolating build steps from the host system.
  *   **Nix Integration**: Seamless environment provisioning using Nix, ensuring every tool needed is available without global installation.
  *   **Local CAS**: A Content Addressable Store that caches build outputs locally to prevent unnecessary rebuilds.
  *   **TUI (Terminal User Interface)**: A rich, interactive terminal interface to visualize build graphs and task progress in real-time.
