`same` is a modern build tool for monorepos designed to make execution hermetic,
deterministic, and fast across any environment.

    Deterministic builds via Nix ensure that if it runs on your machine, it runs on any other machine and on CI.

    Minimal configuration with a clean, uncluttered CLI and TUI.

## Why `same`?

Use `same` if you struggle with:

- **Inconsistent builds:** "It works on my machine" but fails on CI due to
  environmental differences.
- **Complex setups:** Onboarding new developers takes hours installing specific
  compilers and tool versions.
- **Slow CI:** Rebuilding the entire project for a one-line change.

`same` helps by:

- **Locking toolchains:** Uses Nix to ensure every developer and CI runner uses
  the exact same binary versions.
- **Caching everywhere:** Computes input hashes to skip work that has already
  been done.
- **Unifying execution:** One syntax (`same run`) for all tasks, regardless of
  the underlying language (Go, Rust, Node, etc.).

## Stability

<Warning>
`same` is currently in **v0 (Beta)**.
</Warning>

- **Breaking Changes:** The configuration schema (`same.yaml`) and CLI commands
  may change as we refine the design.
- **Production Use:** While reliable for development workflows, please pin
  versions in your CI pipelines.

## Supported Platforms

`same` is built and tested for the following operating systems and
architectures:

| OS        | Architectures                            |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Linux** | `amd64`, `arm64`                         |
| **macOS** | `amd64` (Intel), `arm64` (Apple Silicon) |

> **Note:** Windows is not supported at this time.
