<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize configuration">
    Create a `same.yaml` in the root of your project:

    ```yaml same.yaml
    version: "1"

    # Define tools needed for your tasks (provisioned via Nix)
    tools:
      go: go@1.25.4
      lint: golangci-lint@2.7.2

    tasks:
      # Define a task
      build:
        input: ["cmd", "internal", "go.mod"]
        cmd: ["go", "build", "-o", "bin/app", "./cmd/main.go"]
        target: ["bin/app"]
        tools: ["go"]

      # Define a dependent task
      lint:
        input: ["**/*.go"]
        cmd: ["golangci-lint", "run"]
        tools: ["lint"]
        dependsOn: ["build"]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run a task">
    Run the lint task you just defined:

    ```bash
    same run lint
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Schema

The `same.yaml` file drives the execution engine.

- `version`: Configuration format version (currently "1").
- `project`: (Optional) Name of the project, only required if using a workspace setup.
- `tools`: A map of tool aliases to versions (e.g., `go: go@1.23`). `same` uses Nix to provide these hermetically.
- `tasks`: A map of task names to task definitions.

**Task Definition:**

- `input`: List of file globs or paths that affect the task output. Used for caching hash calculation.
- `cmd`: The command to execute (as a list of strings).
- `target`: List of output files or directories the task produces.
- `tools`: List of tool aliases (defined in the global `tools` section) required by this specific task.
- `dependsOn`: List of other tasks that must complete successfully before this task runs.
- `environment`: Map of environment variables injected into the task execution.
- `workingDir`: Directory to execute the command in. If a relative path is provided, it is relative to the project root (the directory containing `same.yaml`). Defaults to the project root.
